# d3-intro
A short intro to d3js (v4).

## Notes
- I don't have a presentation for this yet ... It might come !
- The examples use jQuery in the first examples for basic SVG manipulation
- They also use lodash for convenient functional helpers / random data generation
- Examples are numbered, and should be taken in order
- Example gallery : https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/gallery
- Cool example to analyze : https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373
